# Part 5: Switch Case - C++ Calculator

## Objectives:
Create a simple calculator using a `switch` statement to perform: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division

## How It Works:
- The user is prompted to enter:
  1. First number (`double`)
  2. An operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
  3. Second number (`double`)
- A `switch` case evaluates the operator and performs the corresponding operation.
